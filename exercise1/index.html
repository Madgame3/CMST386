    <h2>Web Design Info:</h2>
    <p><strong>Question 1: </strong>Do you currently work in Web Design? If so, what do you do?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer 1: </strong> I work in the computer field, but I wouldn't consider myself a web designer. I do occasionaly like to dabble on side projects.</p>
    <p><strong>Question 2: </strong>What scripting languages or web technolgoies do you know? What is your level of expertise?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer 2: </strong>PowerShell! I can actually write some pretty powerful scripts that make my life easier. I can also code in Java but only at a beginner level. Languages I'd like to learn more about include PHP and JavaScript. Currently reading a book on PHP.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Question 3: </strong>In this class, you'll be hand coding HTML and CSS using a text editor, what is your editor of choice?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer 3: </strong>So far I really enjoy Atom. It seems to be a great editor with some powerful features and packages. My favorite feature right now is Atom HTML Preview, which saves me from having to git commit 1000's of times just to preview my work.</p>
