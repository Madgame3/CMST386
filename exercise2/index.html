    <h1>What I want to Learn: Stephen Harrington</h1>
    <p>My biggest struggle as a student is failure to retain knowledge. Sometimes I think it's lucky that I'm able to pick up on something quickly. Other times it's a curse. If you didn't have to struggle to achieve something then you probably didn't have to commit yourself to learning it. Which means you didn't really learn it, you merely borrowed it. Just studying or using something once isn't enough. You have to consistently use it, review it, and continue to grow with it if you hope to retain those skills. I'm not hoping to become a frontend designer, building static pages and making them look pretty isn't my thing. In this Web Design class I want to start chipping away at that border between building static and dynamic pages. I hope to become more confident with Javascript and learn some popular JS libraries such as JQuery. I would also like to start experimenting with server side code specifically PHP with a MariaDB backend. After this class is finished I hope to have some finished products to look back on and review as well as continue developing them into the future.</p>
