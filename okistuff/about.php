       Honestly, we're really not that interesting, but here are some thing that describe us...oh and by the way who's going to the midnight showing of Starwars?????<br><br>
     <strong>Sure, we love puppies and sunny days and walks on the beach, but our real love is toilet paper.</strong><br><br>
     <strong>I never made a mistake in my life. I thought I did once, but I was wrong.  </strong><br><br>
     <strong>Life is like a very long TV show, without a remote control. </strong><br><br>
     <strong>Math is fun, it teaches you life and death information, like when you're cold, you should go to a corner since it's 90 degrees there.</strong><br><br>
